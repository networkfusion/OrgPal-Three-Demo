Some notes to improve lib:

* Better documentation about ensuring "persistent" connections (or not) with documentation (including cloud policy doc for support)
* Add some integration tests, including (scripts to auto provision cloud broker (and/or)) manual setup documents to ensure ease of use.
* Partial Greengrass support?!
* Websocket support?!
